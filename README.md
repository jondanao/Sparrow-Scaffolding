Sparrow Scaffolding
===================

Sparrow Scaffolding is a set of project starter files based on the original Sparrow scaffold and barebone projects. Some of the files were modified to eliminate annoying warnings.

### Things to remember: ###
* ARC supported. Fixed NSAutoreleasePool and cleaned deallocs and releases.
* Works on Sparrow 1.3.
* Have not tested on Sparrow 1.4.
